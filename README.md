So, my name is Joseph but you can call me Amon, I'm 19 years old,a Brazilian guy who loves computing, 
I'm not in college yet but I'm already studying programming languages.
My future plans are to act as CyberSecurity and for now I'm going to focus on front-end,
it's going to be a long road, but I'll get there. So, that's me, enough wasting time and let's study and code.
